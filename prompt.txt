The attached PDF document contains a few tables of opcodes for a fictional
virtual machine. It's in Polish.

I ask you to do the following:
- for each table, create a new Markdown heading and a Markdown table underneath
- for each opcode, create a new row in the Markdown table with the following
  columns:
 - the opcode
 - mnemonic
 - mnemonic name in plain English (**in bold**)
 - parameters (or none)
 - the full description

In the full description cell, try to preserve the structure and formatting of the input PDF (but translate it to English).
It doesn't have to be perfect, but please wrap code with `backticks` and respect newlines.

The document contains 6 tables. For now, focus only on the first one.

Gemini's output was always cut at some random point, and what helped was instructing it to only output n-th table at
once. I had to repeat the process 6 times, but at least it worked.
